This is my WIP private server for Shin Megami Tensei:Dx2

Follow along on my dev journey at [insert youtube link here when done]!

The completed server will aim to have the game fully operational, including multiplayer components

It should be noted that this is a rewrite of my first attempt

The uploaded code will NOT have game assets from Sega's servers. There will be an asset scraper in the tools folder eventually.
